These data are a subset of those found in the file `nanostring data with VG protein data.xlsx` sent to me from Ying Wang and Rob Page in 2017.  In emails from May 26, 2022, both Ying and Rob agreed that I could use these data for ASU's CAS 523 course.

Because the data are not yet published publicly, the data file to be used in the course, titled `Wang_Page_nanostring_data_2016_Day_15.csv`, will be made available for download from the course's Canvas website.


Below are other details about the dataset.

Notes on data from Ying Wang (emailed 6.14.2017): 

Here is the data matrix with the data of VG protein concentrations in the hemolymph. Since we decided it was not needed to include all the time points previously, I donâ€™t have the protein data on day 4.


Ying says of the normalized data (5.29.2017):

The company provide a program called 'nsolver' that does background extraction and normalization. The program uses the  geometric mean of reference genes for the normalization.
Our data was processed by the program and I reorganized in the right format and did further analysis.
