These data correspond to the "Wine Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine 

The original dataset is contained in the file `wine.data`, with metadata in `wine.names`.  I have added a machine-readable file `wine-attributes.csv` that contains descriptors of the attributes given in `wine.names`.
